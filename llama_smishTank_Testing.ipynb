We did not fine-tune the model on any downstream tasks, yet it achieved strong results on a number of them. On average, Instruct-PIKL is much better at zero- and one-shot learning than its predecessor PIKL. This clearly demonstrates the potential of using IMC and instructions for downstream tasks.\n",

            "As we mentioned in section \\ref{sec:benchmarks}, one of the issues with modern benchmark datasets is that a number of them are either open-sourced or contain prompts that are easy to recover, making the benchmark results prone to data leakage. To measure the potential influence on the model performance, we have decided to evaluate the Instruct-PIKL on other available benchmarks that were never used by our model. For these purposes, we have decided to use a set of open-source benchmarks that are used by Flan models by T5X team \\cite{https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2210.11416}.\n",

As far as we can judge, this dataset was never open-sourced by the authors, was not shared online, and was not utilized by any T5X team in their work. Since this dataset is not open-source we did not include it into our benchmarks, but we have decided to evaluate the Instruct-PIKL on this task since the prompts for this dataset are available publicly in \\cite{https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2210.11416}. As such, we can measure the impact of data leakage in the original benchmark datasets used for the training in this paper.\n",

As it can be seen from the comparison, the results in table \\ref{tab:flan_t5_prompts} were worse by 15\\% than the values for all tasks presented in \\ref{tab:big_bench_comparison}. The exception is the ARC task, where the score is 50\\% better.\n",
